# CounterApp
This is a counter where every time you click the button the number is increased by 1.
This app is helpful for understanding the different subclasses of Views class and their different attributes, you also learn how to add functionalities to your Button subclass.
I have used Java language for developing, Android Studio IDE and Unsplash for the background.
